```

### Install Curator with a specific version and deploy jobs

```puppet
class { 'curator':
  version => '3.3.0',
  crons   => {
    'logstash-cleanup' => {
      command     => 'delete',
      subcommand  => 'indices',
      parameters  => "--time-unit days --older-than 7 --timestring '\%Y.\%m.\%d' --prefix logstash-",
      cron_minute => 0,

    cron_minute: '30'
    cron_hour: '*/1'
  puppet-report:
    command: 'delete'
    parameters: "--time-unit days --older-than 14 --timestring \\%Y.\\%m.\\%d --prefix puppet-report-"
```


## Limitations

This module has been tested on Ubuntu and should work on Redhat/CentOS too.

For Redhat/CentOS, you will need to deploy the EPEL repository before using the module (See : https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL). This module doesn't manage EPEL.

## Development

See the CONTRIBUTING.md file. Pull requests are welcome :)
